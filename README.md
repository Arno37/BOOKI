Booki is a web application designed to help users find accommodations and activities in the city of their choice.

## Project Overview

As part of my professional training as a web developer at the startup Booki, I am responsible for integrating the site’s interface using HTML and CSS. I am working closely with Sarah, the CTO, and Loïc, the UI designer.

## My Role

I have been provided with the completed desktop, tablet, and mobile mockups for the site, which I need to integrate. Along with the mockups, there is a summary note detailing the specifications and technical constraints to follow.

To get started, an initial file structure and base code for the project have been prepared:

    - An index.html file containing the initial HTML code that I need to complete.
    - A css folder containing one or more style.css files with preliminary CSS code that I also need to complete.
    - An images folder containing all the images used on the site.
    

This initial code provides the foundational HTML and CSS elements, and I will use it as a reference to develop the rest of the code. I must maintain the same folder structure and continuously version my project on Git throughout the development process.
